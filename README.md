# Book APP Flutter UI

This is simple book app UI made with flutter. It contains two main tabs: </br>
1- your current books(you can manage your books and read it anytime, and you can add short note to it and even summerize what you have learnt from the book)</br>
2- book store( in this app you can see variety of books with different categories)</br>
Each book has a detail page(both your books and book store tabs) where you can find details of each book in that page including: category, total pages, the short note you have added, rating, publisher and even pages that you have read or remain pages!</br>
Since this app doesnt have any DB I just stored all the datas in model folder. You can find Lists that contains all the books in both "your books" and "bookstore" tabs.</br>
